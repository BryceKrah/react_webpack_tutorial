# Using React With Webpack

This is a brief tutorial on setting up the build tools for using react with webpack, including transpiling from es6 to es5
and a JSX transformer. It will also cover setting up a Sass precompiler and minifier.

### Requirements

* node ~ v5
* npm ~ v3
* git ~ v2

### Getting started

Clone this repo, switch to the branch named step-0 and run npm install
```
git clone https://github.com/harryganz/react_webpack_tutorial.git
git checkout step-0
npm install
```

Step 0 has the basic file structure and an express server, but nothing else. You can check if it is working by running ```npm start``` and
visiting http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

If you want to install the dependencies manually, you can run ```npm install```.
